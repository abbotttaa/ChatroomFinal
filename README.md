# ChatroomFinal




Interface Segregation Principle: 

My text logger inherits from Ilog and uses all of Ilogs methods, and not having any un used methods.



Single Responsibility Principle:

The logging class "textlogger.cs" has only one tast: To log the chat. Nothing else is done in that chat, so it has one, and only one responsibility.
